This is a web page.
There's not much here.
Just words.
And you're reading them.

      We've become obsessed with fancy designs, responsive layouts, and scripts
      that do magical things.
    

But the most powerful tool on the web is still words.


      I wrote these words, and you're reading them: that's magical.
    

      I'm in a little city in British Columbia; you're probably somewhere else.
      I wrote this early in the morning, June 20th, 2013; you're reading it at a
      different time. I wrote this on my laptop; you could be reading this on
      your phone, a tablet or a desktop.
    

      You and I have been able to connect because I wrote this and
      you're reading it. That's the web. Despite our
      different locations, devices, and time-zones we can connect
      here, on a simple HTML page.
    

      I wrote this in a text editor. It's 6 kB. I didn't need a Content
      Management System, a graphic designer, or a software developer. There's
      not much code on this page at all: just simple markup for paragraphs,
      hierarchy, and emphasis.
    

      I remember teaching my daughter to code HTML when she was 8. The first
      thing she wrote was
      a story about a squirrel. She
      wasn't ""writing HTML"";
      she was sharing something with the world. She couldn't
      believe that she could write a story on our home computer, and then
      publish it for the world to see. She didn't care about HTML; she cared
      about sharing her stories.
    
You are still reading.

      Think about all the things you could communicate with a simple page like
      this. If you're a businessperson, you could sell something. If you're a
      teacher, you could teach something. If you're an artist, you could show
      something you've made.
      And if your words are good, people will read them.


      If you're a web designer, I challenge you to think about the words first.
      Instead of starting with a style guide or a Photoshop mockup,
      start with words on a page.
    

      What do you have to say? If you don't know, there's not much use in adding
      all that other cruft. Just start with one page, with a
      single focus. Write it and publish it, and then iterate on that.
      Every time you're about to add something, ask yourself: does this help me
      communicate better? Will that additional styling, image, or hyperlink give
      my audience more understanding? If the answer is ""no,"" don't add
      it.
    

At its heart, web design should be about words. Words
      don't come after the design is done. Words are the beginning, the
      core, the focus.
    
Start with words.

      Cheers,
      Justin Jackson
